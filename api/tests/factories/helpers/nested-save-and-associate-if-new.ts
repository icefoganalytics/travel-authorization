/**
 * Recursively saves a Sequelize model instance along with its associated models if they are new (unsaved).
 *
 * It handles `BelongsTo` associations and ensures associated model is saved _before_ the current model,
 * then propagates the foreign key relationship before saving the current model.
 *
 * It handles `HasMany` associations and ensures associated models are saved _after_ the current model,
 * propagating the foreign key relationship before saving.
 *
 * It handles `HasOne` associations and ensures the associated model is saved _after_ the current model,
 * propagating the foreign key relationship before saving.
 *
 * @template M - A Sequelize model type extending `Model`.
 * @param {M} modelInstance - The Sequelize model instance to be saved along with its associated models.
 * @returns {Promise<M>} - Returns the saved model instance.
 *
 * @example
 * // Given a non-persisted TravelSegment model instance, being passed via a HasMany association to a TravelAuthorization model.
 * // The TravelAuthorization is saved first, then the TravelSegment is updated with the travelAuthorizationId before it is saved.
 *
 * const travelSegment = travelSegmentFactory.build({
 *   departureOn: faker.date.past(),
 * })
 * const travelAuthorization = await travelAuthorizationFactory
 *   .associations({
 *     travelSegments: [travelSegment],
 *   })
 *   .transient({
 *     include: ["user", "travelSegments"],
 *   })
 *   .create({
 *     status: TravelAuthorization.Statuses.SUBMITTED,
 *   })
 *
 * @example
 * // Given a persisted TravelAuthorization passed to a TravelSegment model instance via a BelongsTo association.
 * // The TravelSegment is updated with the travelAuthorizationId before it is saved.
 *  const travelAuthorization = await travelAuthorizationFactory
 *    .create({
 *      tripTypeEstimate: TravelAuthorization.TripTypes.ROUND_TRIP,
 *    })
 *  const whitehorse = await locationFactory.create({ city: "Whitehorse", province: "YT" })
 *  const vancouver = await locationFactory.create({ city: "Vancouver", province: "BC" })
 *  const travelSegment1 = await travelSegmentFactory
 *    .associations({
 *      travelAuthorization,
 *      departureLocation: whitehorse,
 *      arrivalLocation: vancouver,
 *    })
 *    .create({
 *      segmentNumber: 1,
 *      departureOn: new Date("2022-06-05"),
 *      departureTime: Stop.BEGINNING_OF_DAY,
 *      modeOfTransport: Stop.TravelMethods.AIRCRAFT,
 *      accommodationType: Stop.AccommodationTypes.HOTEL,
 *    })
 *
 * @example
 * // Given a generic TravelAuthorization creation.
 * // The factory will create the purpose and user associations if they are not provided.
 * // Then the onCreated hook will call nestedSaveAndAssociateIfNew to save
 * // the purpose and user associations as they are new.
 * // Then those associations will propagate their foreign keys to the travelAuthorization before it is saved.
 * const travelAuthorization = await travelAuthorizationFactory.create()
