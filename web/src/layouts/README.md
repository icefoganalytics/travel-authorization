# Layouts

1. Layouts are components that wrap a page or collection of pages.
2. Layouts can't be routed to directly.
3. Layouts follow the naming convention `<ModelName><Action>Layout`.
4. Layouts should attempt to map folder structure to file structure, but might be in a nested folder if there are several layouts for the same model.
